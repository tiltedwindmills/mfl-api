# MFL Fantasy Football API #

This library is meant to simplify Java projects that want to use the [MFL developer's export](http://football.myfantasyleague.com/2015/export), and it simply wraps the HTTP calls for that service into Java objects.

At the moment the implemented features are working, but its definitely in beta stage.  It was originally written as part of an Android application that never saw daylight, and now its being converted into a more general purpose utility.  Only the primary features have made the port thusfar, and some of the code is still being refactored.  As such, there's no guarantee of backwards compatibility moving forward.

More exports are on the way, but aren't planned until after I've solidified the API.  I'm happy to add them early if someone needs it though, so feel free to contact me if something is missing and you need it for your app.
